Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x(position at which tail is connected) = 2
Output: True
Explanation: In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
given. Then value of x=2 is given which
means last node is connected with xth
node of linked list. Therefore, there
exists a loop.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
x = 0
Output: False
Explanation: For N = 4 ,x = 0 means
then lastNode->next = NULL, then
the Linked list does not contains
any loop.

class Solution {
    //Function to check if the linked list has a loop.
    public static boolean detectLoop(Node head){
        // Add code here
         Node slow=head;
        Node fast=head;
        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null){
            slow=slow.next;
            fast=fast.next.next;
            if(slow == fast){
                return true;
            }
            
        }
        return false;
    }
}
